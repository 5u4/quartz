1. I started to do simple trading investment on BTC perpetual market at <a href="https://ftx.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ftx.com</a> (zero fees on limit orders).
   Til writing this post, I have earned 400+ USD with 2000 USD capital and each order has a 6000 USD notional.

2. I was lucky sometimes that I bought on the local minimum and sold on peak; but that's not always the case.
   I have once bought on the high point and the price goes straight down.
   I believe the price will eventually goes up to my desired point. That price took around a day to go back.
   So when the price drop, believe in BTC and just wait...

3. I could split my orders into multiple chunks.
   Some weighted heavier and take lower risk (earn less); the others are placed on ambitious closing point.

## A few questions

- Can I automate these?
- When my capital grow, can the market take my order? (or will my order affect the market?)
